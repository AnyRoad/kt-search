# Security Policy

I update dependencies regularly (using the refresh versions plugin). This should ensure, this project is mostly reasonably up to date most of the time. I expect most security issues would typically relate to dependencies.

## Supported Versions

The latest stable release is generally the only supported release. 

Previous versions of this library under the name es-kotlin-wrapper are no longer supported. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any issues or suspect any issues, file an issue via the issue tracker.

For serious/sensitive issues, contact me via email jilles AT jillesvangurp.com.
