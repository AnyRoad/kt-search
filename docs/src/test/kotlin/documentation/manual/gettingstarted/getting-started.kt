            First you have to create a client. Similar to what the Elastic and Opensearch Java client do, there is a
            simple `RestClient` interface that currently has a default implementation based on `ktor-client`. This client
            takes care of sending http calls to your search cluster.

                The `SearchClient` has a json parameter with the kotlinx.serialization `Json` 
                that has a default value with a carefully constructed instance that is configured
                to be lenient and do the right thing with e.g. nulls and default values. But you 
                can of course use your own instance should you need to.
                           
                There are two instances included with this library that you may use here:
                
                - `DEFAULT_JSON` this is what is used by default
                - `DEFAULT_PRETTY_JSON` a pretty printing variant of DEFAULT_JSON that otherwise has the same settings.
