Uses `kotlinx-cli` to make scripting really easy and enables you to write your own `.main.kts` files. Combined with the out of the box support for managing snapshots, creating template mappings, bulk indexing, data-streams, etc. this is the perfect companion to script all your index operations. Additionally, it's a great tool to e.g. query your data, or build some health checks against your production indices.
