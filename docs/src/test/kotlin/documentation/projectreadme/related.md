There are several libraries that build on kt-search:

- [jillesvangurp/kt-search](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kt-search) - the main Github project for kt-search.
- [kt-search-kts](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kt-search-kts) - this library combines `kt-search` with `kotlinx-cli` to make scripting really easy. Combined with the out of the box support for managing snapshots, creating template mappings, bulk indexing, data-streams, etc. this is the perfect companion to script all your index operations. Additionally, it's a great tool to e.g. query your data, or build some health checks against your production indices.
- [kt-search-logback-appender](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kt-search-logback-appender) - this is a logback appender that bulk indexes log events straight to elasticsearch.
- [es-kotlin-client](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-client) - version 1 of this client; now no longer maintained.
